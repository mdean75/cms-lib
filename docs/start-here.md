## CMS Library Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) as defined in RFC 5652 for the Go programming language. It provides a robust set of tools for creating, parsing, and verifying CMS messages, enabling developers to easily integrate cryptographic message handling into their applications.

### Pre-planning phase

We are currently in the pre-planning phase of the project, where we are gathering requirements, defining the scope, and outlining the architecture of the CMS library. During this phase, we will focus on:

- Understanding the core features and capabilities of CMS as defined in RFC 5652
- Identifying the key use cases and scenarios where CMS is applicable
- Evaluating existing CMS implementations in other languages to inform our design decisions
- Establishing a roadmap for development, including milestones and deliverables
